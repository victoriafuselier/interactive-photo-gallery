 Treehouse Techdegree Project 5: Interactive Photo Gallery

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive photo gallery using JavaScript and CSS Grid Layout. The project starter files consisted of a mockup image for the layout, a mockup image for the lightbox, a text file containing the photo captions, and an images folder containing 12 full size images and 12 corresponding thumbnail images. I was instructed to build a search bar feature at the top of the page to hide and show photos depending on user input. Also, I was instructed to add the functionality of clicking a thumbnail to reveal the full size photo in a lightbox with working 'previous' and 'next arrows.

The basic project requirements included: bulding the web page layout using HTML and CSS to match the gallery mockup image; downloading and installing the JavaScript lightbox plugin baguetteBox.js, structuring HTML to match the baguetteBox usage documentation, and utilizing the baguetteBox JavaScript by calling it in app.js; utilizing the included JavaScript search plugin searchFilter.js; checking code with HTML and CSS validators; learning about and using JavaScript validation tool JSHint.

The extra credit project requirements included: making the CSS Grid thumbnail gallery responsize without using media queries; writing my own JavaScript code instead of using the included plugin for the search/content filtering requirement.

I went beyond the requirements listed above by making the site layout work for screen widths from 320px to 1024px and wider.

    "Great job with this project! You set up your grid to match the mockup beautifully, and you were able to successfully incorporate the JS Plugins for lightbox! You've also gone above and beyond in creating your own code for search functionality. These additional features help to provide a user-friendly project that is easy for your user to view and navigate! Well done!"
